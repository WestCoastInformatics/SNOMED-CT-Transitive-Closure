This HOWTO describes how to use the installer scripts to build a transitive closure table in a database.

Prerequisites
-------------
If loading transitive closure table into a database, first load SNOMED in RF2
using the database load scripts you can also find at the URL above.  This is
important because it creates a view that allows for denormalization of preferred
concept names, thus making the transitive closure table more useful.

Also, the load scripts for Oracle and MySQL both assume that the transitive closure
file has been created in a specific location with a particular filename. See the
default settings at the top of the transitive closure scripts for more info.

The database load script tooling available from 
  http://www.westcoastinformatics.com/resources.html has already been run and the
  database loaded.  This is "add on" functionality to an existing load.

  
Installation
------------
1.  Download the database loader zip file from the http://www.westcoastinformatics.com/resources.html website. Select the appropriate database-version pair (i.e. oracle-US Edition). Depending on your database and edition, identify the appropriate target's zip file.
	For example:
		* MySQL
			> SNOMED-CORE, use the "snomed-transitive-closure-mysql.20190131.zip" file
			> US-Edition, use the "snomed-us-transitive-closure-mysql.20190301.zip" file
		* Oracle
			> SNOMED-CORE, use the "snomed-transitive-closure-oracle.20190131.zip" file
			> US-Edition, use the "snomed-us-transitive-closure-oracle.20190301.zip" file

2.  Unzip the contents of the zip file into a 'data' folder

3.  Copy the same SNOMED CT Release ZIP files used when building the RF2 database in the prerequisite step. 

4.  Open the desired zip file and extract the 'Snapshot' folder into the 'data/rf2' folder. Once completed:
	* The 'data' folder's content will include:
		- 'rf2' folder
		- HOWTO.txt
		- LICENSE.txt
		- README.txt
	* The 'data/rf2' folder's contents will include:
		- 'com' folder
		- 'Snapshot' folder
		- *.sql files
		- *.ctl files (for oracle only)
		- one *.bat file
		- one *.sh file

5.	Generate transitive closures
	In a text editor, open the temp-folder's appropriate "populate" script in a text editor as defined by your platform and database. 
	* For example:
		- Windows          - use the "transitive_closure.bat" script
		- Linux/Unix/MacOS - use the "transitive_closure.sh" script
	* Note: a complete log file will appear as "transitive_closure.log"
	
7.	Load transitive closures
	In a text editor, open the temp-folder's appropriate "populate" script in a text editor as defined by your platform and database. 
	* For example:
		- Windows
			> MySQL  - use the "populate_mysql_db_tc.bat" script
			> Oracle - use the "populate_oracle_db_tc.bat" script
		- Linux/Unix/MacOS
			> MySQL  - use the "populate_mysql_db_tc.sh" script
			> Oracle - use the "populate_oracle_db_tc.sh" script
			
	* Configure settings at the top of the "populate" script for your environment
		- user  is your database's username
		- password is your database's password
		- tns_name or db_name is the database's schema which was used in the prerequisite step

8.	Execute the "populate" script
	* Note: a complete log file will appear as "mysql.log" or "oracle.log"
